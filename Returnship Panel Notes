Question # 1
Moderator: When did you know you should leave your job?
Fatima: My maternal instincts told me that it was time and I was having a very hard time finding a good daycare/nanny for my kids.
Farah: I was missing the bonding time with my kids.
Fauzia: I evaluated all pros and cons and decided that it works for my family that I leave for some time.
Beenish: I was very blessed that our financial situation was such that if I left the job it wouldn’t affect the family. It was my decision and I was very happy with it.
 
 
Question #2
Moderator: Now tell me what was that moment when you decide that you want to/ need to go back to work?
Beenish: I came back to work for my personal happiness. I was content being a mother, but I felt somewhere between kids’ school and home routine I was losing myself.  I had to go back for my happiness and personal growth.
Fauzia: My kids were the reason I left, and my kids are the reason I came back. I want to be the role model for my daughters.
Farah: I came back for my mother. She inspired me to be the contributing member of the community. She belonged to an uneducated family, but she persisted, got herself a degree and started working. She fought against all odds and educated her daughters. Not working meant I was throwing away her legacy. I couldn’t do that.
Fatima: My family is not a typical traditional family where you get dadi key haath ka halwa and ammi ka khana. Women usually don’t play this role. We are through and through feminist flag bearers. So, once when I was visiting Pakistan, we were sitting on the table and our cook got some roti (bread), I said to my dad, “You should come to Seattle I will make garam garam rotis for you”. He slammed his fork on the table and said “Fatima we raised you to become the Prime Minister and you are making chappatis- what are you doing with your life?”. After some soul searching, I felt I had to drop my profession as the rotimatic and go in the career I was supposed to be. I enrolled in UW, did my graduation on top of class; with three young kids at home. My family was my real motivation.
 
Question # 3
Moderator: What steps you took to come back?
Fauzia: I am a planner. I planned to a tee. I wrote down my skillset. It helped me see my path. I gave my self a plan. I knew the courses I had to take to improve my skills. I volunteered, I networked, I showed up at every event, I pushed myself till I was good at it. Finding a career is a full-time job. You need to plan.
Farah: All the things Fauzia said and on top of that I had a candid discussion with my spouse before I planned my returnship. We discussed about the changes we will have to make in our lives. He needs to chip. I talked and trained my kids (CPR, 911 emergency care etc).
Also, remember you don’t have to make your own network, you can use anyone’s network. Use your husband’s network, use network of your friends. I used my husbands network intensively and it worked!
Fatima: Never go to anyone and say I am looking for a job or give me a job. Ask for information. Have a cup of coffee with them and really put effort to understand the company. But treat it like a real interview. Remember! everyone is hiring but it takes away the pressure of the interview if it is over a cup of coffee. So do no mistake, prepare ahead, do your homework. End the conversation with a thank- you email and always follow through. Also, volunteer as much as you can. Volunteering can fill the gap in your resume. Job fairs, local conferences are also wonderful resources.
Beenish: I am not an engineer or related to IT world, so my network was zero. I went back to school and got a certificate in my field that helped me build my network. So, going back to school for a degree or a certificate helps your confidence and also helps you build network.
Moderator– I agree, formal courses and even online courses can boost your skillset. It looks good on your LinkedIn too.
 
Question # 4
Moderator:  What was your first job and how did you find it?
Fatima: I recommend people to get the foot in the door job. Don’t spend too much time in finding the perfect dream job. Once you are a perfect candidate, you have worked hard and you prove yourself, you will gradually move up the ladder.  
Farah: I wanted to create my own path so I used the available network and got the foot in the door job. Use your Pakistani network, mentors from the community, set up mock interviews. These things helps a lot.
Fauzia: It is important to put yourself out there. I was once at a seminar of code.org and a friend of mine offered me a volunteer position. I took the job, it opened doors for me and improved my skillset.
 
Question: Audience
How to prep for an interview?
Fatima: Mock interviews is the way to go. Write down all question the interviewee can possibly ask and try to answer the questions. Amazon has a unique interview process. So, if you are applying at Amazon, meet people at Amazon and ask them about their experience. Also, UW has great resources, you can set up mock interviews. It is very important that you prepare an elevator pitch. Have a star approach in your introduction. Talk about the task – your action and then your approach.
Beenish: Having quick snap shots of your career highlights in your mind helps in an interview. Write your answers. Get questions from online resources and prepare/ refine them as much as you can. Practice practice.
Fauzia: At Perdue University they taught us to record our answers of the interview and then review the tape and see if you would hire yourself. Mock interviews are important. Ask your husband to interview you. Reach out to the community and specially professionals who are in that field.  
Modertor: I interviewed with serval companies I didn’t really care about to boost my confidence, so when I apply to the company I really want to go I feel prepared.
Fauzia: Just be careful if you are rejected too many times, your morale might be shaken.
Farah: I scheduled all mock interviews at interviewees work places. It gave me the experience and feeling of a real interview. For technical interviews you need to practice on whiteboard. When you are practicing on your own always use a white board.
 
Question : Audience
How do you do work life balance?
Beenish: There is no balance. Take your work with kids or vice versa. Work life integration. I sometimes take phone calls while my kids are playing in the park. It is tough. Just flow with it. It gets easy with time.
Fatima: I did my graduate degree with 3 kids. You need support. My friends looked at my kids while I went to school. My husband picked up the slack. You must lean on your support.
Beenish : You need to seek support.

Thank you everyone
for coming.
The group broke down into four smaller groups.
